<h1> What is chemistry ?</h1>
<p> 
   Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of elements and compounds, how they can change, and the energy that is released or absorbed when they change.

</p>
<p> --> Atom is the basic element in chemistry </p>
<h1 class="h1">Atom </h1>
<p>
  <ul>
  • An <strong>"Atom"</strong> is smallest particle of matter.<br>
  • According to the scientist Jhon Dalton "Matter consists of smallest particles which are indivisible".<br>
  •After conducting some experiments scientist proposed that" atom contain some subatomic partocle called <Strong> Proton,Electron,Neutron </strong>".<br>
  </p>
  </ul>
<br><br><br>




 <h2 class="h2"> • Sub-atomic Particles</h2>

<p>
  <ul>
  • The subatomic particles are three,they are <strong>"Protons,Electrons,Neutron"</strong>.<br>
</ul>
</p>
<h3 class="h3"> Proton </h3>
<p>
  
 -> Proton is discovered by Ernest Rutherford in the year 1917 - 1919.<br><br>
  ->Proton is having positive charge.<br><br>
  ->proton is represented as p<sup>+</sup>. <br><br>
  ->Proston present in the nucleus of the atom.<br><br>
  ->Proton has mass of 1.67262 × 10 <sup>−27 </sup> kg, which is 1,836 times the mass of an electron. <br> <br>
  ->Relative mass of proton is 1<br><br>
  ->Proton has charge of "+1.6 x 10 <sup> -19 </sup>"

</p>
<h3 class="h3"> Electron</h3>
<p>
->Electron is discovered by J.J.Thompson in the year of 1897. <br><br>
–>Electron having Negative charge. <br><br>
->Electron is represented as e<sup>-</sup>. <br> <br>
->Electron present around the nucleus in orbits. <br> <br>
->Electron has mass of 9.1 x 10 <sup> -31</sup> kg,which is about1/1836 of a proton  mass.<br> <br>
->Relative mass of electron is 0.0005. <br> <br>
->Electron has charge of "-1.6 x 10 <sup> -19 </sup>"
</p>

<h3 class="h3"> Neutron </h3>
<p>
  ->Neutron is discovered by james chadwick in the year of 1932 .<br> <br>
  ->Neutron is having no charge. <br><br>
  ->Neutron is represented as "n". <br><br>
  ->Neutron present in the nucleus.<br><br>
  ->Neutron has mass of 1.67262 x 10<sup>-27 </sup>. <br><br>
  ->Relative mass of Neutron is 1. <br><br>
  ->Neutron has "0" charge. <br><br>
